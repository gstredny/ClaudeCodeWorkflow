# Advanced: Agent Teams

### Multiple Claude instances working in parallel

**Use when ALL four are true:**
- Work spans multiple files with clear ownership boundaries
- Tasks can run independently in parallel
- Each piece produces a clear deliverable
- Time savings outweigh coordination overhead

### How it works:

- **Lead agent** — delegate mode, coordinates only, owns task file
- **2-4 teammates** — each owns specific files, reports via messaging
- **No file overlap** between teammates (non-negotiable)
- Lead logs all teammate results to the task file, tagged by role

### Quick check:

"Can I draw file-ownership lines with zero overlap?"
- **Yes** = agent team candidate
- **No** = single agent

**Speaker notes:**
Agent teams are an accelerator, not a default. Most tasks are single-agent. Teams shine when you have genuinely independent work across different layers — e.g., one teammate on the API, one on the frontend, one writing tests. The workflow phases don't change — teams slot into Phases 2 and 4.
