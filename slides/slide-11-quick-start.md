# Getting Started: 5 Minutes

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI installed
- Claude AI browser access (claude.ai)

### Step 1: Run the installer
```bash
cd ~/workflow-starter-kit && ./install.sh
```
Installs global hooks, settings, and optionally sets up a project.

### Step 2: Customize CLAUDE.md
- Keep Task Management section verbatim
- Add your project's Critical Rules with WHY blocks
- Add your constraints

### Step 3: Create your first task
```
"Create a task file in docs/tasks/open/ for:
[describe what you want to accomplish]"
```

### Step 4: Follow the loop
Plan (browser) -> Explore (CLI) -> Review (browser) -> Execute (CLI) -> Verify -> Close

**Speaker notes:**
The install script is interactive — it asks before every operation and won't overwrite existing files without permission. The starter kit repo is at [repo URL]. Clone it, run install.sh, and you're in the workflow. The CLAUDE.md will grow organically as you discover project-specific rules.
