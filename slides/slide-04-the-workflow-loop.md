# The 7-Phase Workflow Loop

```
Phase 1  PLAN .............. Claude AI (browser)
   |     Define success criteria, tests, constraints
   v
Phase 2  EXPLORE ........... Claude Code (CLI)
   |     Check tasks, explore codebase, generate plan
   v
Phase 3  REVIEW ............ Claude AI (browser)
   |     Challenge assumptions, simplify, improve
   v
Phase 4  EXECUTE ........... Claude Code (CLI)
   |     Implement. Log every attempt to task file
   v
Phase 5  CODE REVIEW ....... Claude AI + Claude Code
   |     Plan review, execute review, log findings, fix issues
   v
Phase 6  VERIFY ............ You + Claude Code
   |     Walk Done Criteria one by one
   v
Phase 7  CLOSE-OUT ......... You
         Approve. Retro entry. Move to closed/
```

### Two tools, one loop

- **Claude AI (browser)** = Thinking (plan, review, review planning)
- **Claude Code (CLI)** = Doing (explore, execute, review execution)

---

**Speaker notes:**
Most tasks follow all 7 phases. Simple bugs might skip Phase 3. Code review findings bounce back to Phase 4 for fixes. Failed verification bounces back to Phase 4 for rework. Documentation-only tasks skip Phase 5 (set "Code Review: not required"). Code review follows the same plan/explore/review/execute sub-loop. The key discipline: every phase produces an artifact — plans are written, attempts are logged, findings are recorded, criteria are checked off. Nothing lives only in your head.
