# AI-Assisted Development with Claude Code

### A Task-Driven Workflow for Reliable, Repeatable Results

Built over 60+ tasks on a production codebase.

**Speaker notes:**
This workflow solves Claude Code's biggest limitation: it forgets everything between sessions. We give it persistent memory through task files, project rules, automated enforcement hooks, and a retrospective log. The result: Claude picks up exactly where it left off, never retries failed approaches, and improves over time.
