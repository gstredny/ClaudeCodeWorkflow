# The Problem

### Claude Code forgets everything between sessions

- Every new session starts from zero
- No memory of what was tried or what failed
- You repeat yourself constantly
- Same mistakes happen over and over
- "What were we doing again?" every time

### The result without a system:

- Wasted time re-explaining context
- Retrying approaches that already failed
- No institutional learning across tasks
- Inconsistent quality

**Speaker notes:**
Claude Code is powerful but stateless. Without a system, every session feels like onboarding a new developer who knows nothing about your project. This workflow solves that.
